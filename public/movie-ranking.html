<h1>The Best Movies According to Jonel </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Hit Man</h3>
<p>This movie tells me that I can be whoever I want. "It's not too late to seize the identity that you want for yourself and chase what makes you happiest" </p>

<h3>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba â€“ The Movie: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>This movie or series is my favourite anime. I really love the high quality images and animation from the studio.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>As a potterhead how can I not include this one in my list :>. The series was so good that I had to watch it for the 9th time (and probably I'll watch it again and again). </p>
