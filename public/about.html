<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Jonel Amodia, an aspiring web developer currently diving into the exciting world of coding and web development. While I may be new to the field, my passion for creating and building digital experiences is driving me to learn and grow every day. I'm currently enrolled in courses and dedicating my time to self-study, with a particular focus on mastering JavaScript, one of the core technologies of web development.</p>

<p>One of the aspects I enjoy most about web development is the satisfaction of writing code and seeing my ideas come to life on the screen. The process of turning a blank page into a functional and visually appealing website is incredibly rewarding, and it fuels my desire to continually improve my skills. Although I'm just starting out, I'm eager to learn and master various technologies, starting with JavaScript and eventually expanding to frameworks and tools that can enhance my projects.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in coding, I love spending my time playing games. This hobby not only provides a fun escape but also inspires my creativity and problem-solving skills, which I bring back to my web development journey. I'm excited about the future and the endless possibilities that web development offers, and I'm looking forward to building innovative projects and making a mark in the tech world.
